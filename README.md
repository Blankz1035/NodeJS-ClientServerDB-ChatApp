# NodeJS-ClientServerDB-ChatApp

Applications such as WhatsApp and Viber have always intrigued me on the developments of these type of application architectures. This project has a "toe in the pond" of possibilities of enhancement and i am currently working on a new version including specific chat rooms, separate messaging and secure log in.

Demo chat application with push notifications of new messages sent from 1 client to another using the HTTP module. Messages are stored using NoSQL DB MongoDB. 

## Getting Started

To check out this application, go ahead and install the dependencies using the Package.JSON file and NPM install. Run NODEMON  (great module in your projects!) to initialise the server and open Chrome at LocalHost:3001.

### Prerequisites

```
1. NodeJS.
2. Chrome Browser.
3. Nodemon module (would be a plus for live reloading).
4. Online MongoDB hosting for your DBUrl connection string.
```
### ToDo after installing

To preview this application working, you will need to locate and document your DBURL connection string obtained in your online hosting provider. 

I recommend to use cloud.mongodb.com. The Atlas hosting capabilities are huge, showcasing separate clusters for your applications.

Once you have modified the DB connection URL, compile your project in NodeJS using NPM start or nodemon. The server will start up, and you should see no errors. 

Finally open two windows in the Google Chrome browser. Load up the localhost:3001 address and start chatting! 

## Thanks for review!
