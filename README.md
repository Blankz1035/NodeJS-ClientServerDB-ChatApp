# NodeJS-ClientServerDB-ChatApp

Applications such as WhatsApp and Viber have always intrigued me on the developments of these type of application architectures. This project was a "toe in the pond" of possibilities of enhancement that i am currently working on for an Application.

Demo chat application with push notifications of new messages sent from 1 client to another. Messages are stored using NoSQL DB MongoDB. 

## Getting Started

To check out this application, go ahead and install the dependencies using the Package.JSON file and NPM install. Run NODEMON  (great module in your projects!) to initialise the server and open Chrome at LocalHost:3001.

### Prerequisites

```
1. NodeJS.
2. Chrome Browser.
3. Nodemon module (would be a plus for live reloading).
```

## Thanks for review!
